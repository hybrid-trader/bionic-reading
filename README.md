# Bionic Reading

A simple yet effective take on the bionic reading method to help ADHD users. The method was developed by Renato Casutt, various apps can be found at the following link (https://bionic-reading.com/) 

However there are times when I have found the need to not remove all the dressing from a page, that and I wanted to create a userscript for the fun of it. It is pretty simple in its use, iterating through most of the recognisable text on a page and rendering the first half of them bold, <b>whi</b>ch <b>hel</b>ps <b>so</b>me of us <b>wi</b>th ADHD to <b>foc</b>us <b>bet</b>ter <b>wh</b>en <b>rea</b>ding.

To use this script first install Tampermonkey or similar:
- [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)
- [Firefox extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/)
- [Other browsers](https://www.tampermonkey.net/index.php?ext=dhdg)

Simply click the script below to install the script or view source to see what's in there.

When you get to a page you wish to transform into bionic text if you right-click on the page you should see a context menu similar to below. Simply click on the userscript option as shown below, which will transform the text (where possible) from the text shown on the before shot to the text shown in the after shot.
